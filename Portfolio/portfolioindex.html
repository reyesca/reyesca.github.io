                Welcome! My name is Angel, I am a first-generation college student in my family. I'm a transfer student from East Los Angeles College who 
                will be attending the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) as a Junior. GO BRUINS &#128059! Im currently majoring in Mechanical 
                Engineering with a passion and desire to work in the aerospace industry.
            </p>
            <p>
                When Im not stressing about my courses I enjoy going out on adventures with my colleagues and try new things. I've always been very active as a kid
                so I enjoy working out, bike riding, playing sports <span style="color: #ff0000;">(Warning: I tend to get competitive)</span>, Im very opened to anything.
                Or sometimes after a long day I just like to relax and binge watch Tv shows like the Big Bang Theory.
